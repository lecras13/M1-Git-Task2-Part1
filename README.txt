Task 2
Part 1
We are going to practice some skills obtained in the previous task. If you come across something you still donâ€™t know, please use links provided in the descriptions, internet search, other mentees and you mentor as sources of knowledge and help. For this task you will create two separate branches git_1 and git_2 in your remote repository and local tracked branches with same names. Both these branches should be made of the git_task branch.

git_1: Add and commit firstFile.txt file with 10 lines.
git_1: Add and commit secondFile.txt file with 10 lines.
Merge branch git_1 to git_2
git_2: Update and commit any two lines in secondFile.txt.
git_1: Update and commit the same 2 lines with the different info in secondFile.txt
Merge branch git_2 to git_1, resolve conflict. Left all (4) modified lines. Commit.
git_1: Update and commit 1.txt file, modify two lines.
git_1: Update and commit 1.txt file, modify another two lines.
Transfer changes of commit from Step 7 only to git_2, using format patch.
Transfer changes of commit from Step 8 only to git_2, using cherrypick command.
git_2: Concatenate the last two commits using reset + commit commands.
git_2: Change date, author and message of the last commit and add non-empty thirdFile.txt file to it.
git_2: Create a new commit that reverts changes of the last one.
git_2: Create and commit thirdFile.txt file.
git_2: Run command that removes all changes of the last two commits.
Synchronize git_1 and git_2 with a remote repository.
Clone your project to another folder.
folder2: git_1: Change two lines in firstFile.txt. Commit + Push.
folder1: git_1: Change another two lines in firstFile.txt.
*folder1: git_1:
Change another line in firstFile.txt (not the same as in 18, 19).
Merge changes from Step 18 (pull) without committing changes from Step 19 and any additional commits.
Push.
Return local state of Step 19. (stash)
